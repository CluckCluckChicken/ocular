# ðŸ˜Ž ocular
ocular (formerly jeffalo post viewer) is an open source collection of tools for the scratch forums.

## tools
- forum search
- stats
- cool data stuff

## how is such a cool thing even possible?
i'm glad you asked. 
- data from [DatOneLefty's ScratchDB](https://scratchdb.lefty.one/) (it's not possible without it)
- styling inspired from [Maximouse](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Maximouse)
- vercel is used for deployment because of the super neat features (it currently should be acting just like github pages though)
- vue is used because it's super cool and basically does all the dom manipulation
- and obviously scratch!
